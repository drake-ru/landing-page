A landing page for a website. Rather generic and first attempt at creating a visually appealing website from scratch. Aim is to create a website to the designated brief as closely as possible utilising the HTML and CSS skills I have gained thus far.
Skills explored/demonstrated shall be:

- HTML - skeletal website building including images and links
- CSS - basic design including flexbox arrangements
